### Added
- **Map view**: If you are editing a game script, you can use this feature to determine the correct location of the character by placing it on the map.

- **Map coordinates**: After the map is loaded, you can see the x, y value of a desired point at the top left corner by moving the mouse.

- **Birth points**: The starting points of the game on the map are shown in red and blue colors. It just shows. I haven't added any editing or changing features yet.

- **Drag the character feature**: To drag the character, you can drag it by left-clicking while pressing the CTRL key. When you don't press CTRL you select the hitbox area.
